### Environment Setup

CAST is built with cmake and depends on the [LLVM project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project).

CAST is under active developments. The development enviromnent of CAST requires a specific structure of LLVM installation, and we recommand compiling and installing the LLVM project afresh.
